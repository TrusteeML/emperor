# AI/ML and Network Security: <br>The Emperor has no Clothes

Reproducibility artifacts for the paper AI/ML and Network Security: The Emperor has no Clothes.

## Overview

Each of the use cases and related work presented in this repository has its own set of dependecies, described inside each associated [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/) environment.

However, all the use cases presented depend on the implementation of our ***Trustee*** framework and Trust Report, which was implemented in a separated Python library, we called `scikit-explain`,  to facilitate using it in other projects.

The `scikit-explain` library can be found [here](https://github.com/anon4papers/scikit-explain)
